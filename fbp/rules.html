              <p>Fantasy Beer Pong is an alternative rule set to beer pong that is intended to add a level of skill, tactics and fun into the already successful game. In Fantasy Beer Pong every player takes the role of a class, and through the classes abilities they drastically change the way they play the game.</p>

                <h2>Game Structure</h2>
                <p>In a game of Fantasy Beer Pong, every player must choose a class at the start of the game. We typically pick Round-Robin style but feel free to pick however you want.</p>

                <h3>Classes</h3>
                <p>In Fantasy Beer Pong we have 6 classes; Assassin, Berserker, Guardian, Ranger, Warlock, Wizard. These classes are derived from the classic fantasy archetypes. See the class specific rules <a href="#classes">below</a></p>

                <p>Each class has a set of abilities that modify their play, these are unique to each class and strongly influence the players choices throughout the game. Abilities are broken into two categories, Active & Passives.</p>
                <h4>Active Abilities</h4>
                <p>Active Abilities are power-ups that you can use after your team has Re-Racked. Active abilities must be announced, failing to do so will prevent their use. Active Abilities do not have to be used immediatly after a Re-Rack you may choose when to use them. However, Active Abilities do not stack, you can only have 1 stored at a time. Active abilities typically involve removing extra cups or nullifying an enemy shot.</p>
                <h4>Passive Abilities</h4>
                <p>Passive Abilities are power-ups that are always on. These abilities play a huge role in defining a classes play-style. Each passive is unique and should play a large part in how you play each class.</p>

                <p>Passive Abilities cannot be used on Last Cup, except for <i>Stealth</i>. This means you cannot Aim Shot the last cup. You cannot cast Reckoning when both enemies miss the last cup. You cannot buff/debuff someone shooting on last cup. If a Wizard makes last cup he does not get the ball back from Flammable.</p>

                <h2>Beer Pong Rules</h2>
                <p>Anyone who has played Beer Pong can tell you that there are more rule variations than anyone could possibly keep track of. We thought about this a lot during the design phase, doing our best to avoid specific beer pong rules which would create conflicts. Here are the only ones we enforce in Fantasy Beer Pong</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Each team gets 2 Re-Racks per game.</li>
                  <li>An intentional bounce shot counts as 2 cups made.</li>
                </ul>


                <p>That's it! Feel free to combine any variation of your own rules with ours, just don't expect them all to be balanced and mesh with the game perfectly (we can't test for everything...)</p>
